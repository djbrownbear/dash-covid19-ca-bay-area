### Project to see trends in Covid-19 cases and maintain Python and web-development skills.
### I started this project as a Juypter notebook but have since deployed it as a dash app.

### Contra Costa County did not have a way to see Covid-19 data trends on a more granualar level 
### (i.e. on a per city basis). However, they provide the data as a download in Excel format, so I
### built a simple script to download the data each day (starting in Fall 2020). For Alameda county
### the data was open source, but in March 2022 the data source is no longer available.
