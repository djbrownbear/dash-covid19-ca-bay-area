# dash-covid19-ca-bay-area

## Technologies

1. Python / Plotly / Dash / Flask

2. HTML5 / CSS

## Background - TLDR
The [dash-covid19-ca-bay-area](https://dash-covid19-ca-bay-area.herokuapp.com/) project was built out of curiosity to see the 14 day moving average of Covid-19 cases in nearby California cities. It was also a good way to maintain Python and web-development skills.
I started this project as a Juypter notebook but have since deployed it as a dash app.

## More Background 
Contra Costa County did not have a way to see Covid-19 data trends on a more granualar level (i.e. on a per city basis). However, they provide the data as a download in Excel format, so I built a simple script to download the data each day (starting in Fall 2020). 
For Alameda county, the data was open source, but is no longer available as of March 2022. 

*Note*: the [source data](../main/NumberCases.csv) is filtered to only include 3 cities from each county and is only meant for demonstration purposes.
